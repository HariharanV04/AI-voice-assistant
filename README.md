 AI-Powered Voice Assistant Development

This is a sample of my skillset in using AI powered voice assistant using Openai's Chatgpt using api.

Streamlit is used for the basic UI functions and the streamlit dashboard shows weather report using a weather api along with a voice assistant.
Using the voice assistant the user can set an alarm and during the alarm it plays a given alarm sound(in my case the alarm sound is prowler_theme).
Since streamlit does not support multithreading in the true sense, the alarm hinders the working of the voice assistant. The voice assistant works as usual
after the alarm has been triggered.
